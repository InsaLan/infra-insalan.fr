# insalan.fr infrastructure

This repository is here to hold all insalan.fr infrastructure.

# Contributing

Please read carefully [the CONTRIBUTING.md file](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before any
contribution.

## Installing and running insalan.fr in local

```sh
git clone git@github.com:InsaLan/infra-insalan.fr.git --recurse-submodules
cp .env.dist .env
chmod 0600 .env
```

Edit your `.env` with your local settings then:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-beta.yml up --build -d
```

You can also launch the beta synchronously to get the logs:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-beta.yml up --build
```

Then to stop the containers:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose-beta.yml down
```

The website is available at the value of `WEBSITE_HOST` which should be
`insalan.fr` or `insalan.localhost` depending on where it's running.  It's API
backend is available at `api.WEBSITE_HOST`.

The "beta" environment is available at `beta.WEBSITE_HOST` and it's own API at
`api.beta.WEBSITE_HOST`. There is hotreload for the front (with
[vite](https://vite.dev/)), back (with django runserver), and nginx (thanks to a
custom script).

## Running the prod environment

Put 0 in the .env file for the `DEV` variable.
Run the following command:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml build
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
```

To stop the prod environment:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down
```

The dev frontend is available at `WEBSITE_HOST` and it's API at
`api.WEBSITE_HOST`.

## Tests

It's important to run the tests to ensure that you didn't break anything.

```sh
docker exec infra-insalanfr-beta-backend-1 python manage.py test --parallel auto
```

## Makefile

A [makefile](./Makefile) has been created to create shortcut for the command
presented above. For example, you can launch the beta just by typing:

```sh
make run-beta
```

And you can run the tests with

```sh
make test-back
```

## Cleanup

Docker can take a lot of disk space with all the images.
You have a few options to clean it up:

- `make clean-all` will remove all the containers and images
- `make clean-custom` will remove all the custom images (the ones we build and
  not the ones we pull from docker hub)
